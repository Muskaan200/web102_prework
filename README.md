## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
*Sorting and Filtering Data: Implementing the correct sorting and filtering for funded and unfunded games was tricky at first.
*Managing dynamic DOM updates for adding/removing game cards based on filters took some trial and error.
*Creating a GIF (or video) walkthrough of the app was a bit challenging as I had to learn how to capture the right parts of the app’s functionality .
